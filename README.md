# IT2660---Data-Structures-Algorithms-Week2

Similar to the example code I provided in the course material, demonstrate that you can create your own custom array class, with dynamic memory allocation to resize the array as needed, supporting the various standard operations of arrays, such as appending items, inserting items at a position, removing items from a position, etc.
The goal here is to demonstrate that you know how to manage the re-sizing of primitive arrays. (i.e. when you keep adding things to an array at some point you have to destroy the old one and create a new bigger one in its place, copying the old values to the new bigger array)
